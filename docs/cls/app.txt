    copy_file_values
    
        Single values placed into: ["txt/last_id_profile.txt", "txt/last_id_post.txt"]
        Store into the document containers the last index value from each repository
        This way, the next object created (profile or post) will have its id based on these values
        
    translate_and_copy_from_file_content_to_virtual_array

        Retrieve content from ["txt/posts.txt", "txt/profiles.txt"] before the algorithm starts
        The content from both will be placed as instances from each repository
        Each line from each document is converted to an instance and appended to the arrays of instances
        This will, there will be no data loss, because history has always been retrieved
